Mathematica code that uses self-similar approximation theory (e.g. see 2505.12119) to study possible critical phenomena in the theory of strong interactions. We, for example, determine the location of the critical point that people are currently looking for in heavy-ion experiments (see e.g 2410.02861). The lattice data is from 2507.13254 and 1309.5258. .
